# Welcome This is My Quiz for SKYCATCHFIRE

## I built this site using React

- The main reason I did this is because it's my strong suit. Also I did see that your company uses Angular and I thought they share similar concepts.

- It is laid out using CSS Grid this makes the most sense to me and you can get very precise with it.

## Some of the issues I ran into

- The first tough issue I ran into was the lines in the header, I wasn't quite sure how you did that. I first tried a couple solutions I found on CodePen using display:table; and span tags with borders representing the lines. When I decided this wasnâ€™t accurate enough,  I decided to create a vector image of a line with a white background and center it then laid out the whole header with its own grid.

- Getting the logo and quotes positioned correctly (which still isn't perfect) I completely forgot about position:relative; (parent)/position:absolute; (child).

- Getting the logo I just ended up badly photoshopping it from the image you provided.

## The Things I would like to touch up if I had infinite time

- I would like to fix up the quote section I don't know if it was the font I used or they way I placed it but it doesn't exactly line up.

- My grid spacing

- overall letter spacing needs some fine tuning

- I wish I would have made all the pictures one component that I could re-use more than once.
